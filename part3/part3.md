1. The bug was that num1 and num2 were strings. Since they were strings, the addition just concatenated the two. That is why the result was just the two numbers next to each other.
2. In order to fix this problem, we can just type cast num1 and num2 to numbers. That way, they will actually add. We can do this using the Number() function.
